Then, do a glissando (sliding down through notes) to find the note where your voice rests most comfortably.\\n*   **Drop Your Jaw:** Once you've found that comfortable note, drop your jaw while maintaining the same relaxed feeling as the hum. Avoid tension or changing the sound.\\n*   **Sing a Phrase:** Choose a phrase from a song and sing it, trying to maintain the same relaxed feeling from the initial hum. Don't worry about the correct pitch initially; focus on the relaxed sound.\\n*   **Maintain Relaxation:** Carry this relaxed feeling throughout your voice, even when singing in different ranges. Even when belting, aim for the same ease in your throat.\\n*   **Play with Pitch Variations:** Practice singing the same phrase at different pitch levels (higher and lower) to see how it changes and to get comfortable carrying that relaxed feeling throughout your range.\", \"Here's a summary of how to run, based on the video transcript:\\n\\n*   **Posture:** Stand tall with your head high, shoulders open, tummy tucked in, and hips facing forward. Imagine a line dissecting your body from your feet to your ears, maintaining it with a slight forward tilt while running.\\n*   **Feet and Ankles:** Aim for a midfoot strike with a slight bend in your knee to absorb shock. Avoid overstriding by landing your foot underneath your body as it moves backward.\\n*   **Running on the Spot Drills:** Incorporate high knees (bringing knees to hip height) and butt kicks (flicking heels towards your hands) to improve foot landing and posture.\\n*   **Hips:** Engage your glutes and ensure hip flexibility for full leg extension and propulsion.\\n*   **Shoulders and Arms:** Keep your shoulders relaxed and use your arms to drive you forward with a gentle bend in your elbows, close to your torso. Avoid movement across your body.\\n*   **Head:** Keep your head in line with your body, looking far ahead to maintain posture and avoid excessive movement.\\n*   **Breathing:** Utilize your full lung capacity by breathing deeply into your belly. Practice breathing exercises before running to stay relaxed.\\n*   **Footwear:** Get fitted for appropriate running shoes at a specialist store.\\n*   **Strengthening:** Strengthen your core and hip muscles to maintain good posture.\"]\n",
